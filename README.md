## ü§î what

a collection of specialized claude agents that get better at their jobs over time. 

think of it as hiring a team that never sleeps, never complains, and actually learns from their mistakes.

## üöÄ why

your ai assistant should level up faster than you do. 

these agents don't just execute tasks‚Äîthey analyze their own performance, identify patterns, and evolve their strategies. it's like having a team that does retrospectives after every commit.

## how claude works here

### 1. agents as markdown
each agent is defined in `.claude/agents/` as a markdown file that tells claude:
- what it specializes in
- which tools it can use
- when to activate
- how to self-improve

### 2. self-healing automation
this repo uses github actions + claude api to:
- check agent configurations daily
- fix sync issues automatically
- suggest improvements based on usage
- maintain itself without human intervention

### 3. using agents in claude code
```bash
# in claude code, just mention the agent
@agent-repo-updater   # maintains agent configs
@agent-chief-product-officer   # reviews ui/ux
```

## ‚ö° quickstart

```bash
# clone the collection
git clone https://github.com/nvsio/claude-code-subagents

# add agents to your project
cp -r .claude /your/project/

# that's it. agents are now available via @ mentions
```

### try it out
```bash
# in claude code:
> @agent-repo-updater check my agent configs
> @agent-chief-product-officer review this UI component
```

## üé≠ current roster

### `@agent-repo-updater` 
*the meticulous librarian*
- keeps all agents in sync between markdown and json
- suggests optimizations based on usage patterns
- self-improves by analyzing git history

### `@agent-chief-product-officer`
*the design perfectionist*
- reviews ui/ux for consistency and accessibility
- catches wcag violations before your users do
- ensures your error messages don't suck

## üîÑ self-healing magic

this repo literally maintains itself:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[push code] --> B[github action triggers]
    B --> C[claude checks health]
    C --> D{issues found?}
    D -->|yes| E[auto-fix & commit]
    D -->|no| F[vibes ‚ú®]
```

### enable it in your repo
```bash
# 1. add secret
gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# 2. copy workflow
cp .github/workflows/self-healing.yml /your/repo/

# 3. that's it. your repo now self-heals.
```

## philosophy

- agents should be excellent at one thing
- self-improvement isn't a feature, it's table stakes
- if it's not making you faster, it's not worth it

## ü§ù contribute

drop a PR. doesn't have to be perfect‚Äîclaude will review it automatically and help polish it.

### what happens when you PR

1. **instant review**: claude reviews your changes within ~30 seconds
2. **constructive feedback**: get specific suggestions, not just "lgtm"
3. **automatic validation**: repo-updater checks your agent configs
4. **helpful labels**: auto-tagged based on what you changed

no gatekeeping. we want your ideas.

### ideas we'd love to see

```yaml
test-runner:
  pitch: "runs only tests affected by your changes"
  vibe: "the pragmatic qa engineer"

doc-writer:
  pitch: "generates docs that devs actually want to read"  
  vibe: "the technical writer who gets it"

perf-optimizer:
  pitch: "finds bottlenecks you didn't know existed"
  vibe: "the speed demon"

security-scanner:
  pitch: "catches vulnerabilities before the hackers do"
  vibe: "the paranoid friend you need"
```

### how to add an agent

**option 1: request an agent** (easiest)
1. ‚≠ê star this repo (required)
2. [create an issue](https://github.com/nvsio/claude-code-subagents/issues/new?template=new-agent-request.yml) with your idea
3. claude generates a world-class agent for you
4. review and merge the PR

**option 2: build your own**
1. create `.claude/agents/your-agent.md`
2. define its personality and capabilities
3. submit PR
4. watch repo-updater validate & improve it

rough edges welcome. perfect is the enemy of shipped.
