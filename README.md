# claude-code-subagents

self-improving ai agents that actually workâ„¢

## what

a collection of claude code agents that get better at their jobs. they learn. they adapt. they ship.

## why

because your ai assistant should level up faster than you do

## how

```bash
# clone it
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-code-subagents

# agents live in .claude/agents/
# they're just markdown files that define superpowers
```

## current roster

- **repo-updater**: maintains this very repo. meta? yes. useful? absolutely.

## philosophy

- agents should be excellent at one thing
- self-improvement isn't a feature, it's table stakes
- if it's not making you faster, it's not worth it

## contribute

drop a PR. make it good. we have standards (the repo-updater will tell you)
