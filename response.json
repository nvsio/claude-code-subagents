As an AI assistant, I don't have direct access to files or repositories unless their contents are shared in our conversation.\n\n## Recommendations üìù\nTo provide a thorough code review, I would need:\n\n1. The contents of `agents.json`\n2. The list of markdown files in the `.claude/` directory\n3. The specific agent configurations you'd like me to review\n\nIf you could share these details, I would be happy to provide a comprehensive analysis checking for:\n- JSON syntax validity\n- Documentation sync\n- Configuration completeness\n- Best practices compliance\n\nWould you please share the relevant repository contents for review?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":121,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":254,"service_tier":"standard"}}
