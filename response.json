To provide a thorough code review, I would need:\n\n1. The contents of `agents.json`\n2. The markdown files for each agent\n3. Any additional configuration files present\n\n## üí° Recommendations\nTo proceed with a proper review, please:\n\n1. Share the relevant repository files\n2. Provide the directory structure\n3. Include any specific agent configurations you'd like reviewed\n\nOnce these are provided, I can offer:\n- Detailed syntax validation\n- Documentation consistency checks \n- Configuration completeness analysis\n- Specific recommendations for improvements\n\nWould you please share the repository contents you'd like me to review?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":121,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":271,"service_tier":"standard"}}
